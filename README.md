<h1>UTC Homework Helpbot</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<b>This repository will contain software to help UTC students (and others) with homework. The goal is to emphasize learning rather than cheating. ChatGPT is ever so prevalent in today's society and cheating comes naturally with it. The goal of this project is not to help users cheat, but to provide a better method of searching the internet for relevant study material. We believe that this software will encourage users to learn by providing quick and easy access to relevant material instead of searching all over Google (taking away from time spent actually learning).
